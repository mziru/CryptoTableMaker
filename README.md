# CryptoTableMaker
A simple web app for generating lightly customizable tables from CoinMarketCap data. Results can be viewed in the browser and downloaded as .csv files. The app requires an API key, which can be acquired here: https://coinmarketcap.com/api/. CryptoTableMaker works (for now) with a free Basic account. This site is not affiliated with CoinMarketCap and should be used in accordance with all Terms of Service agreements.
